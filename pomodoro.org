* Preamble
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  * We talk frequently about techical abilities but not about /soft skills/
  * Attitude is that some people have good soft skills and others don't
  * e.g. Kevin and Gray are good at talking to clients
  * time management is one of these soft skills
  * Challenge: not often clear how to improve at these /soft skills/
  #+END_NOTES
* Disclaimer
  I am not qualified to give advice about time management.
  #+ATTR_HTML: :width 50%

  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  * Time management not something I am good at
  * work in progress
  * Found Pomodoro 1 week ago
  * other people could benefit from it
  * other time management techniques
  * if you know you're probably better at it than me
  #+END_NOTES
* I Suck at Time Management
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  * traditionally bad at time management.
  * Something that has come up a number of times for me.
  #+END_NOTES
** Symptoms of Bad Time Management
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   * two biggest problems with how I work.
   * difficult to catch because you still /feel/ productive
   #+END_NOTES
   1. Gold plating
   2. Working on a task tangent to the real goal
** Gold Plating
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   * Still met the same requirements in the end.
   * Took much longer because of idealized solution.
   * 'Perfect' solution doesn't matter if the spec if wrong.
   #+END_NOTES
   A.k.a. going into the rabbit hole.
** Working Tangent to Goal
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   * Everything takes longer because you aren't really working to your goal.
   * Difficult to catch because you /feel/ productive.
   * Big problem is how it affects other perception of how long it takes you to complete something.
   #+END_NOTES
* ... But I'm trying to get better
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  * Assessed what i thought my issues were.
  * Came up a couple things i wanted to do that I thought would help.
  #+END_NOTES
** Things I thought could help
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   Don't go into detail.
   #+END_NOTES
   #+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag grow
   1) Limit time on tasks.
   2) Keep better personal time logs.
   3) Review what I spend time on throughout the day.
* It already exists
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  As with most things, someone already invented this management system.
  #+END_NOTES
* 🍅 Pomodoro 🍅
  #+BEGIN_NOTES
  * Simple, low-tech technique to improve *focus* and *flow*.
  * if you want all you need is pencil paper and
  #+END_NOTES
  Simple, low-tech technique to improve *focus* and *flow*.
** History
   * Who cares!
   * Francesco Cirillo developed it in the late 80's
** 1. Decide on the task to be done.
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   * Keep a TODO list
   * pick a task
   #+END_NOTES
** 2. Set the Pomodoro timer
    #+BEGIN_NOTES
    * low tech option is a kitchen timer
    * could use a phone timer or youtube
    * i use a timer in org mode.
    #+END_NOTES
    * Traditionally 25 minutes.
    * Every 25 minute block is a /Pomodoro/ 🍅.
    #+ATTR_HTML: :width 30%
    [[http://brittbrouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/timer.jpg]]
** 3. Work on the task until the timer rings
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.
   #+END_NOTES
** 4. Put a checkmark on your TODO list
   Each checkmark is a /Pomodoro/ you've completed towards your task.
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   You can use whatever method you want to track your time, but if you want to go
   strict pencil and paper this is all you have to do, don't need timestamps
   #+END_NOTES
** 5. Take a break
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   * take a moment to let your mind calm down
   * I write a note about what i worked on for the last Pomodoro before i forget.
   #+END_NOTES
   After each Pomodoro take 5 minute break.
** 6. Take a longer break
   Every fourth Pomodoro take a 20 minute break.
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   * let's you cool off a bit
   * assimilate the information
   * important for me because when I get really narrow focus on tasks.
   #+END_NOTES
* Benifits
** Personal accountability
   #+BEGIN_NOTES
   * breaking work into chunks
   * scheduled intervals to revaluate what you've spent time on
   * most time i will waste is 25 minutes
     + without having to feel guilty about it
   #+END_NOTES
